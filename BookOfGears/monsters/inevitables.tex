\subsection{Inevitables: Enforcing Natural Law}
%By Quantumboost

The Inevitables are unusual among ``exemplary'' creatures from Mechanus in that they actually don't have the Outsider (Law) type; they're straight-up Constructs. They're still Extraplanar, and they still have the Law subtype, but they're forged from steel and other metals, or at least the closest Outer Planar equivalents. What they represent among the creatures of Law is the idea of Law as ``universal rules'' -- that there is some code which should be obeyed by all beings, and that if you don't abide by it super fighting robots from another dimension will come and stop you from disobeying if and when they find out.
