\subsection{Books}

\desc{One of the most important and interesting things one can find in a cooperative storytelling game is a book. It's a story within a story, a source of potentially needed information and it's not really game breaking for your character to have it. It is for this very reason that virtually every Dungeon Magazine includes at least one book that the characters can find.}

So what do books actually do? Well, the obvious thing is that if there are any spells in them, you can copy those down into your spellbook (or your \spell{secret page} manifest pad, if you're a modern wizard). But even if they are completely mundane they can still be useful. If you have enough of them on a subject you can have a \emph{Library}, which allows you to take 20 on Knowledge Checks. And a book about a specific subject can allow a character to spend an hour in study to make a knowledge check as if you had an appropriate Area of Expertise. So if you are confronted with a hobgoblin wartabard, and you can't make a sufficient Knowledge Geography or Knowledge History check to figure out where it comes from -- you can bust out a copy of \underline{Bastions of the Goblin Khanate} and try to find a match -- then you can make another knowledge check with the much lower DC.\\
