= Google Code Hosting =

Google Code hosting is primarily intended for the hosting of projects that are creating new code; this project is rather concerned with using existing code (the LaTeX distribution) to publish new _content_.

The only _code_ we are arguably writing is new definitions for LaTeX functions (\half, \third, etc), but this is a minor portion of our effort. Since we are not explicitly releasing these separately, they arguably are a part of the Work as whole.

Currently, our "code" is licensed under the GPL and our content is licensed under the CC BY-SA license.
